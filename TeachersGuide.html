                    Introduction to Fine Art Techniques introduces students to the application and critique of significant fine art techniques. Each lesson provides students with the opportunity to learn about one technique through engaging real-world activities designed to address how and why that technique is used by artists.

                	Lessons can be accessed through the main navigation bar. Each tab represents one fine art technique. After selecting a technique to study, students will be taken to a 4-part lesson designed to help students reach the course objectives.

                        <strong>1. INTRODUCTION:</strong> Here students will watch a short introductory video on the technique. Students are asked to consider how they would <strong>identify and describe</strong> the technique.

                    <li>
                        <strong>2. LECTURE:</strong> Here students will watch a lecture video on the <strong>technical aspects</strong> of and <strong>vocabulary</strong> associated with the technique. Students are asked to take notes in the provide space, or on their own, as they watch. Teachers are able tp review students' notes.

                    <li>
                        <strong>3. STUDIO:</strong> Here students will begin by watching a video demonstrating the technique. Students are then asked to <strong>apply the technique</strong> in a piece of their own. This piece is then upload and displayed on the page. Next, student rate the successfulness of their work in applying the technique. Finally, the students are asked to write a <strong>reflection</strong> on their experience with applying the technique and on their sketch's successfulness in relation to the technique. Teachers are able to view the student's upload sketch, their rating and their reflection to determine if the student has achieved the course objective.

                        <strong>4. CRITIQUE:</strong> Here students will watch a video that considers the work of a master artist who is know for the technique. Students are asked to consider the artist's <strong>technical as well as evocative use</strong> of the technique as they watch the video. Then students are asked to select two pieces to critique in relation to the technique. Suggested resources are listed and efforts are made to respect copyright. Students provide links to the selected works which are then displayed on the page. Finally, students are asked to write a <strong>critique</strong> on the pieces to include: 1) a description of the piece in terms of artist, medium, title, date, location and subject mattter, 2) an analyize each piece in terms of how the work is contructed with regards to the technique, including points of emphasis 3) a description how each piece makes the student think or feel. Comparing and contrasting the selections is also recommended. Teachers are able to view students' linked selections and critiques to determine if the student has achieved the course objective.

                    Introduction to Fine Art Techniques has been created with flexiblity in mind. While students can work through the lesson independently, teachers can also use the lessons as part of a flipped classroom. In the latter case, students could be assigned one or more lesson to complete prior to classtime. Already introduced to the technique's application and critique, classtime is free for engaging in more collaborative experiences. This could include feedback and coaching on studio submissions, debating all of the pieces selected for critique, visting artists locally or virtually to discuss their use of the technique or perhaps apply the technique in a community serve project. Of course, classtime could also be used as studio time allowing teachers to interact with students as they work on more advanced individual projects.
